#Web Blocker

Simple script to disable certain websites whenever you are working/studying on your computer and you might unconsciously get distracted by unwanted content. No more!

*Note: You might need to flush DNS cache for applying the changes. For this reason I suggest not to add and remove in continue but to actually disable those links on that pc (as I did).*


# How it Works?
1. Add any link that you want on "links.txt". 
2. Run the script.
3. Choose "ADD" to add to the filter or "REMOVE" to remove it from the filter.
